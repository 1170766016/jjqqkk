# Chromium with built-in SSL VPN

This Chromium is built from source code with built-in SSL VPN enabled. Users will be able to bypass firewalls and unblock any websites with Chromium.

Chromium is Google's open-source web browser project. It is a fully functional browser on its own and supplies the vast majority of code for the Google Chrome browser.

The Chromium code is also widely used by other parties to create their own browsers. Many vendors use the code in a similar manner as Google, while others simply build it as-is and release browsers with the Chromium name.
